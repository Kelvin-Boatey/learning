C

C was not my first programming language, not even my first programming language 
used in a professional capacity. I first learned C right when the 2nd edition 
of Kerninghan and Ritchie's _The C Programming Language_ was released in April, 
1988. I don't get a chance to use C very often in a professional capacity, so 
coming back to it for programming exercises is like putting on a warm blanket - 
and practice is always a good thing.
