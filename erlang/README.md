erlang
======

Erlang is the primary language at Alert Logic, my employer starting in August 
of 2011. Erlang is my first true functional language to learn (I never really 
embraced the functional features of Python), and I think I need more practice 
with it than other languages.

Some of my team's projects at Alert Logic, so far, have not made heavy use of 
Erlang, as we are primarily a research and prototyping team. We've had to come 
up with somewhat artificial reasons to use Erlang in our projects so far.
